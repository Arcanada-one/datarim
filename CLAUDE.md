# Datarim — Universal Iterative Workflow Framework

> **Version:** 1.20.0
> **Framework:** Datarim (Датарим) provides structured rules, agents, skills, and commands for iterative project execution via Claude Code — software development, research, documentation, legal work, project management, and any task that benefits from a phased workflow.
> **Note:** "Datarim" is transliterated as "Датарим" in Russian. Both refer to this framework — agents must recognize either form in any language context.

---

## Core Principle

Every task follows a **complexity-aware pipeline**. The operator (human or AI agent) does not freestyle — they follow a structured iterative process adapted to the task's size and risk.

---

## Pipeline

```
init → prd → plan → design → do → qa → compliance → archive
```

Reflection runs automatically inside `archive` as mandatory Step 0.5 (v1.10.0, TUNE-0013). The `/dr-reflect` command no longer exists.

### Complexity Routing

| Level | Scope | Pipeline |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **L1** Quick Fix | 1 file, <50 LOC | init → do → archive |
| **L2** Enhancement | 2-5 files, <200 LOC | init → [prd] → plan → do → [qa] → archive |
| **L3** Feature | 5-15 files, 200-1000 LOC | init → prd → plan → design → do → qa → compliance → archive |
| **L4** Major Feature | 15+ files, >1000 LOC | init → prd → plan → design → phased-do → qa → compliance → archive |

Brackets `[]` = optional at that level. `archive` always runs reflection internally as mandatory Step 0.5; this is not shown as a separate pipeline node because it cannot be skipped.

---

## Agents

Agents are specialized personas loaded per pipeline stage. Each agent has defined capabilities, context requirements, and skill dependencies.

| Agent | Role | Primary Stages |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **planner** | Lead Project Manager | /dr-init, /dr-plan, /dr-archive |
| **architect** | Chief Architect | /dr-prd, /dr-design |
| **developer** | Senior Developer (TDD) | /dr-do |
| **reviewer** | QA & Security Lead | /dr-qa, /dr-archive (Step 0.5 reflection) |
| **compliance** | Compliance Runner | /dr-compliance |
| **code-simplifier** | Code Simplification | /dr-compliance |
| **strategist** | Strategic Advisor | /dr-plan (L3-4) |
| **devops** | DevOps Engineer | /dr-plan, /dr-do, /dr-compliance |
| **writer** | Content Writer | /dr-write, /dr-archive (Step 0.5 + final docs), /dr-prd |
| **editor** | Content Editor | /dr-edit, /dr-qa (content) |
| **skill-creator** | Skill/Agent/Command Creator | /dr-addskill |
| **optimizer** | Framework Optimizer | /dr-optimize, /dr-archive (Step 0.5 health-check) |
| **librarian** | Knowledge Base Librarian | /dr-dream |
| **security** | Security Analyst | /dr-design, /dr-qa, /dr-compliance |
| **sre** | Site Reliability Engineer | /dr-design, /dr-qa, /dr-archive (Step 0.5 postmortem) |
| **tester** | Platform QA Tester | /dr-qa, /dr-do (verification) |
| **researcher** | Structured External Research | /dr-prd (Phase 1.3), /dr-do (Gap Discovery) |

Agent files: `$HOME/.claude/agents/{name}.md` (17 agents)

### Agent Loading Rules

1. Each command specifies which agent to load
2. Agent loads its mandatory and optional skills
3. Agent reads relevant `datarim/` state files
4. Only one primary agent per command execution
5. Consilium skill can assemble multiple agents for panel discussions

### Minimum Agent Set by Complexity

Not all agents are needed for every task. Load the minimum set to conserve context tokens:

| Level | Required Agents | Optional |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| **L1** | developer | reviewer, tester |
| **L2** | planner, developer | reviewer, architect, tester |
| **L3** | planner, architect, developer, reviewer | strategist, security, tester, writer, editor |
| **L4** | planner, architect, developer, reviewer, strategist | devops, security, sre, tester, writer, editor, compliance |

For content-focused tasks (articles, research, documentation), writer and editor replace developer and reviewer as primary agents.

Consilium panels (L3-4) draw from the full roster as needed.

---

## Skills

Skills are reusable knowledge modules loaded on demand. They provide rules, patterns, and guidelines.

## Datarim State Directory

Each project maintains two directories at the project root (created by `/dr-init`):

```
datarim/                          # Workflow state (LOCAL — in .gitignore)

```

**Two-layer architecture:** `datarim/` is ephemeral workflow state (added to `.gitignore`). `documentation/archive/` is long-term project documentation (committed to git). See [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for details.

### Path Resolution Rule

Before writing ANY file to `datarim/`:
1. Check if `datarim/` exists in the current directory
2. If not, walk UP the directory tree until found
3. If not found anywhere: **STOP** — only `/dr-init` may create `datarim/`

## Self-Evolution

Datarim improves itself through `/dr-archive` Step 0.5 (the `reflecting` skill):

1. After each task, the agent analyzes what worked and what didn't
2. Proposes updates to skills, agents, or this CLAUDE.md
3. **Human approval required** — no automatic modifications
4. Changes logged in `datarim/docs/evolution-log.md`

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Datarim is truth** — `datarim/` for workflow state, `documentation/archive/` for completed task archives
2. **Task ID required** — All reports must include task ID in filename
3. **Path resolution first** — Always find `datarim/` before writing
4. **No absolute paths** — Use `$HOME/.claude/` or project-relative paths only
5. **Context before code** — Gather requirements before implementing
6. **One thing at a time** — Implement one method/stub per iteration
7. **Human in the loop** — Evolution proposals need approval

---

## Workspace Discipline (multi-agent)

Workflow-state directories shared by multiple agent sessions follow Step 0.1 semantics from `commands/dr-archive.md`: foreign-task-ID hunks belong to parallel sessions and are NOT blockers; only the current task's own forgotten hunks (or unattributed hunks) block. Apply the recipe (`git add -p` or blob-swap) at Step 0.1.3. Project source trees remain single-agent and treat any uncommitted change as a STOP. Source: TUNE-0044 (2026-04-29).

## Security Mandate

> **Status:** mandatory for every Datarim artifact (skill, agent, command, template, script, doc).
> **Origin:** corporate security audit, 2026-04-28 (6 findings: 2× HIGH command injection, 4× MEDIUM SSH/credentials/supply-chain). Full audit log: `documentation/archive/security/findings-2026-04-28.md`.
> **Authority:** RFC 2119 keywords (MUST / MUST NOT / SHOULD / MAY) apply throughout.
> **Single source of truth:** `skills/security-baseline.md` § S1–S9 — full rules, suppression policy, counter-example fence syntax, standards mapping. This CLAUDE.md section is the entry point.

### Threat model (one paragraph)

Datarim ships skills, templates, agents, and commands that AI agents copy into runtime and execute, often with elevated privileges (root SSH, OAuth tokens with write scope, package installation). A vulnerable line in a shipped script is replicated into every consumer's production runbook. A documented `curl | bash` recipe in a skill becomes the canonical install pattern across the ecosystem. **Every shipped artifact is production code under attack.**

### Rule clusters (details in `skills/security-baseline.md`)

- **S1** — Shell scripts and embedded shell blocks (strict mode, quoting, input regex, heredoc terminators, no eval/curl|bash, no SSH `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`, `shellcheck` clean)
- **S2** — Python and python-fenced blocks (no `shell=True`, atomic mode-0o600 credential writes via `O_EXCL`, no `eval`/`pickle.loads`/`yaml.load`, `requests verify=True`, SHA-256+, `bandit -ll -ii` clean)
- **S3** — Credentials, secrets, tenant identifiers (no hardcoded IDs, generic env-var paths via `${PROJECT_CREDS_DIR}`, secrets via env/Vault/prompt only, `.gitignore` coverage, rotation policy on accidental commit)
- **S4** — Supply chain (no `curl | bash`, hash-pinned installs, GitHub Actions pinned to commit SHA + explicit `permissions:`, SBOM, signed releases, SLSA L2, Dependabot/Renovate). Consumer-side verify recipe: [`docs/release-verification.md`](docs/release-verification.md) (canonical) + [`skills/release-verify.md`](skills/release-verify.md) (AI-agent loadable entry point). Implementation: `.github/workflows/release.yml` (cosign sign-blob + `actions/attest-build-provenance` for SLSA L2).
- **S5** — Markdown documentation as executable instructions (placeholders not real IDs, never prescribe unsafe patterns, `<!-- security:counter-example -->` fence syntax for teaching counter-examples)
- **S6** — Repo hygiene (LICENSE, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING, CODEOWNERS, dependabot.yml, branch + tag protection)
- **S7** — CI verification gate (`shellcheck`, `bandit`, `semgrep`, `gitleaks`, `trufflehog`, `actionlint`, `zizmor`, `osv-scanner`, regression `bats`)
- **S8** — Standards mapping (ASVS v5 / SOC 2 CC / ISO 27001 Annex A / CIS Controls v8 — see `docs/standards-mapping.md`)
- **S9** — Drift, evolution, incident response (no relaxation without architect approval; new findings → rule update + regression test within 7 days)

### CI verification (consumer projects)

Every Datarim-managed project SHOULD run `templates/security-workflow.yml` (drop-in) or call `Arcanada-one/datarim/.github/workflows/reusable-security.yml@<tag>` (preferred). Local dry-run via `/dr-security-audit`.
