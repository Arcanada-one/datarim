# PLAN Command

This command generates a detailed implementation plan in `datarim/tasks.md`, strictly following the **Enhanced Design Process** (Phases 4-6).

## Instructions

0.  **RESOLVE PATH**: Before any read/write to `datarim/`, find the correct path by walking up directories from cwd. If `datarim/` is not found anywhere, STOP and tell user to run `/dr-init`. Do NOT create it — only `/dr-init` may create `datarim/`. See `$HOME/.claude/skills/datarim-system.md` § Path Resolution Rule.

1.  **Analyze Context**:
    -   Read `datarim/tasks.md` (Complexity, Requirements).
    -   Read `datarim/activeContext.md` (Current Context).
    -   Review `datarim/prd/*.md` if available.

2.  **Strategist Gate** (mandatory for L3-4, optional for L2):
    -   Load `$HOME/.claude/agents/strategist.md`.
    -   Evaluate:
        -   **Value** — is this worth building?
        -   **Risk** — what's irreversible?
        -   **Cost** — what's the minimum viable experiment?
    -   If strategist recommends pivot or cheaper alternative, present to user before proceeding.

3.  **Detailed Design (Phase 4)**:
    -   **Component Breakdown**: List every modified and new file.
    -   **Interface Design**: Define function signatures, API contracts.
    -   **Data Flow**: Trace input -> processing -> output.
    -   **Security Design**: Perform **Threat Modeling** and map to **Security Controls** (Appendix A).

4.  **Create Implementation Plan (Phase 5)**:
    -   Update `datarim/tasks.md` using the **Design Document Template**.
    -   Include: **Security Summary** (Attack Surface, Risks), **Architecture Impact**, **Detailed Design** (API, DB, Config), **Security Design** (Threats, Controls), **Implementation Steps**, **Test Plan** (Unit/Integration/Security), **Rollback Strategy**, **Validation Checklist**.

5.  **Technology Validation**:
    -   Document technology stack selection.
    -   Verify dependencies and build configuration.

6.  **Output Summary**:
    -   Confirm task status update.
    -   List next steps: `/dr-do`.

## Template Structure (Design Document)

The plan in `datarim/tasks.md` MUST include: **Overview**, **Security Summary** (Attack Surface, Risks), **Architecture Impact**, **Detailed Design** (components, API, DB), **Security Design** (Threat Model, Appendix A controls), **Implementation Steps**, **Test Plan**, **Rollback Strategy**, **Validation Checklist**, **Next Steps**. (Enhanced Design Process Phases 4-6.)

## Security Requirements (Appendix A)

-   **Principles**: Fail-closed, Least privilege, No secrets in code/logs.
-   **Anti-Patterns**: Trusting user input, Logging sensitive data, Hardcoding secrets, SQL concatenation, Unvalidated file paths.

## Transition Checkpoint

Before proceeding to `/dr-design` or `/dr-do`:
```
[ ] Requirements clearly documented?
[ ] Components and affected files identified?
[ ] Definition of Done is testable and explicit?
[ ] Boundaries stated (what we DON'T do)?
[ ] Technology stack validated (if applicable)?
[ ] tasks.md updated with implementation plan?
```

## Usage

Run: `/dr-plan`
